<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The USSR always sends Tear Down This Wall to space.  It is <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">unplayable at DEFCON 2</a>, but even at DEFCON 3 the event is too strong to trigger.</p>
<p>The two best ways to guard against Tear Down This Wall are <a title="Warsaw Pact Formed" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/02/20/warsaw-pact-formed/">Warsaw Pact Formed</a> and East Germany overprotection.  This event is another reason to fight for Poland against <a title="John Paul II Elected Pope" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/08/john-paul-ii-elected-pope/">John Paul II Elected Pope</a> and Solidarity, since control of Poland defends against a realignment of East Germany.  It is also why Czechoslovakia is a common dumping ground for free USSR influence from <a title="Comecon" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/01/24/comecon/">Comecon</a> or Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>The defining card of the US Late War <a title="Regions: Europe" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/regions-europe/">Europe</a> onslaught.  Tear Down This Wall all but guarantees the takeover of at least one European battleground and is a key factor behind most US Late War Europe Control victories.</p>
<p>You almost always want to realign, since only Italy among the battlegrounds has a low enough stability to consider couping, and even then it&#8217;s not coupable at DEFCON 2.  The most common realignment targets are France and East Germany: France you should have significant positive modifiers on, and East Germany is usually the last USSR battleground in Europe standing between you and Europe Control.</p>
<p>To maximize Tear Down This Wall&#8217;s effectiveness, try to hold it to combine with other European events like <a title="East European Unrest" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/04/02/east-european-unrest/">East European Unrest</a> or <a title="Chernobyl" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/12/18/chernobyl/">Chernobyl</a>.  In addition, try to prepare your realignment with better odds—if you plan to realign East Germany, you&#8217;ll want to take over Poland and Czechoslovakia before doing so, lest you just realign away your own influence.</p>
<p>Rules clarification: the &#8220;free coup&#8221; only signifies that you are permitted to coup in Europe even if DEFCON is lower than 5.  It still degrades DEFCON if you coup a battleground.</p>
