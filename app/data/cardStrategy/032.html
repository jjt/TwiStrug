<p>UN Intervention&#8217;s nice event text comes at a cost: playing it cuts your handsize, eliminating your ability to hold a card to next round and posing a bit of a problem if you have multiple bad cards in your hand.  Accordingly, the Space Race is usually a better way to dispose of bad cards, but sometimes you will have no choice but to use UN Intervention.</p>
<p>Because UN Intervention prevents event text from triggering, it does not remove starred events from the game.  UN Intervention is therefore best played with unstarred events, or truly awful starred events. Something like Blockade hurts, but you&#8217;re probably better off just triggering it rather than using UN and reshuffling the card to return at a possibly more troublesome time.</p>
<p><a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide cards</a> are naturally the first priority for UN Intervention, especially CIA Created / Lone Gunman, which cannot be sent to space.  Otherwise, UN Intervention is best with very high Ops cards (which you could send to space, but would prefer having Ops &#8212; Marshall Plan is a good example) and unspaceable cards (which you can&#8217;t send to space).  In particular, UN Intervention is a great way for the USSR to dispose of the nasty US Mid War 1 Op events like OAS Founded.</p>
<p>In the Mid War, UN Intervention has interactions with U2 Incident (not meaningful) and We Will Bury You (much more meaningful).  As US, you should simply make sure you play UN Intervention (if necessary) before U2 Incident if you have both in your hands, and immediately after We Will Bury You (if you are so fortunate).</p>
<p>It is tempting to keep holding UN Intervention between Action Rounds to wait for a &#8220;bad&#8221; card to play it with (and to deny it to your opponent).  This is not a terrible idea, but be mindful that a) you are limiting the potential Ops in your hand; b) if you draw multiple DEFCON suicide cards, UN Intervention is not necessarily much help because of its handsize reduction effect.</p>
