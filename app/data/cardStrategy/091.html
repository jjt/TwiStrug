<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An unattractive event, since the influence is removed from a rather unimportant country, and your choices for the coup are the three most stable countries in the region (and you don&#8217;t even get Mil Ops for it).  Maybe you can headline it and coup Cuba to drop DEFCON in the headline or protect Cuba from realignments.  And it&#8217;s kind of funny to wipe out a lot of US influence from Nicaragua if they over-couped it and had it at 6/0 or something.  But I haven&#8217;t ever seen it played for the event by the USSR.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows about Lone Gunman, but Ortega is the hipster&#8217;s <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide</a> card.  If you have any influence in Cuba, then Ortega is unplayable at DEFCON 2.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have influence in Cuba, then Ortega is not much of a concern.  The USSR usually gets a coup against 3-stability Costa Rica with a 2 Ops card, Nicaragua gets emptied, and I can just play back into Nicaragua if I really care about it (which I probably don&#8217;t).</p>
