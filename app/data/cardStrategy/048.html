<p>Kitchen Debates incentivizes you to take battlegrounds, but you should already be incentivized to do that anyway.  There&#8217;s not much to say about this card &#8212; if the US is ahead on battlegrounds, you lose 2VP; if the US isn&#8217;t, then you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I find Kitchen Debates to be more helpful as a rough barometer of how I&#8217;m doing.  Start worrying if the US has more battlegrounds <em>and</em> is ahead on VP.</p>
<p>Note that this card is <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6399698#6399698">not</a> removed from the deck if triggered while the prerequisite is not met.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>1 Op is usually not very helpful, and 2VP often is.  Unless you have some immediate use for the 1 Op, I prefer the 2VPs and the opportunity to poke my opponent in the chest.</p>
