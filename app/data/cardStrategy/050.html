<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>You often see this played for Ops, because 4 Ops is a lot of Ops, and the USSR ordinarily does not want to drop DEFCON.  If you really wanted to drop DEFCON to 2, you can usually just use the card for a nice coup.</p>
<p>However, there are certain situations where you want to drop DEFCON in the headline phase.  Perhaps the US made an <a title="General Strategy: The AR7 Play" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/03/15/general-strategy-ar7-plays/">AR7 play</a> and you&#8217;d prefer your AR1 to be spent doing something other than couping.  Perhaps you think the US will drop DEFCON in their headline and a DEFCON victory is one of the few ways you can win the game.</p>
<p>And of course, sometimes you just want 3 VPs.  It&#8217;s a ton of VPs, and towards the end of the Mid War, if you can lower DEFCON, 4 Ops for 3 VPs is a decent trade. Indeed, what usually pushes me to headline it is the combination of the VPs plus the chance for an instant DEFCON win.</p>
<p>The 3VPs take precedence over any card played by the US, so if you play We Will Bury You on at -17VP, and the US plays a scoring card worth +10VP on its next AR, We Will Bury You goes first and ends the game before the US scoring card is tabulated.</p>
<p>Note that you can almost always headline this safely, since it is a 4 Ops event, meaning the only possible US headline that would take precedence and drop DEFCON is Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide</a> card almost all of the time, and even when it isn&#8217;t automatic suicide, 3VP is a lot to give up.  I almost always send this to space.  You could theoretically use this as a way to drop DEFCON in the headline if you have <a title="UN Intervention" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/05/07/un-intervention/">UN Intervention</a> in your hand, but you&#8217;d probably prefer to just use UN Intervention with this for the 4 Ops.</p>
