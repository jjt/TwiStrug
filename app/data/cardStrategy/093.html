<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Along with Che, Iran-Contra Scandal is one of the most underrated events in the game.  The reason it is so powerful (compared to Latin American Death Squads) is that the modifier applies to all US realignment rolls, including their rolls on your realignments.  So it&#8217;s not a speculative event: you headline it and then go nuts realigning the US in the Mid War regions.  Suddenly, now that even rolls are favorable, it is a lot easier to find good realignment targets.  No need to hold onto both Colombia and Brazil to realign Venezuela any more; just one of the two will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Play it on your last Action Round, though you can sometimes get away with playing it merely very late if the USSR doesn&#8217;t have time to set up a realignment.</p>
