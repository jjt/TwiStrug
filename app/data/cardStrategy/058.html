<p>Of the three <a title="The China Card" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/31/the-china-card/">China Card</a> events (<a title="Nixon Plays the China Card" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/13/nixon-plays-the-china-card/">Nixon Plays the China Card</a> and <a title="Ussuri River Skirmish" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/20/ussuri-river-skirmish/">Ussuri River Skirmish</a> are the others), this one has the least useful &#8220;if you already have the China Card&#8221; effect.  1 VP for 3 Ops is pathetic and almost never worth the trade.</p>
<p>However, claiming the China Card face-up is much more lucrative: having the China Card helps protect you from <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide</a> and makes it much easier to manage your hand.  I will therefore often play this to claim the China Card if I can spare 3 Ops.  If I already hold the China Card, I usually just use Cultural Revolution for the Ops, but occasionally I&#8217;ll play the China Card first, and then take it back with Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>If for some reason you know that the US is holding Cultural Revolution (say, on Turn 7), it&#8217;s nice to play the China Card, giving it to them face-down, and forcing them into a difficult decision (hold Cultural Revolution to next turn, space it, or play it and give back the China Card face-up).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>By definition, the China Card is worth at least 2 VPs because whoever holds it at the end of the game gets 1 VP.  So there&#8217;s no reason to play this and just hand over the China Card, especially face-up.  If you draw this holding the China Card, you should always play the China Card first, then trigger it for a measly -1 VP.  And if you draw it while the USSR holds the China Card, try to play it as soon as possible, because the only time this card is really annoying is when you have the China Card face-down.</p>
