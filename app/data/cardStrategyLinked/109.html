<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>A surprisingly good headline for the USSR.  Given the value of VPs at this stage, it essentially blocks the US from all but the most essential coups.  This allows you to spread aggressively through the Mid War non-battlegrounds, safe in the knowledge that the US is unlikely to coup.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are not interested in the Mid War regions, then this card loses a lot of value, since that was where the US was going to coup anyway.  But it is also very powerful if you combine it with improving DEFCON or use it to counter <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Play it on your last Action Round for no effect.  You can also play it slightly earlier if you need to and it won&#8217;t be disastrous.</p>
