<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>One of the best (and most underrated) USSR events.  Launching two simultaneous coups allows you to set up countries for realignments, defend against US AR7 moves, or threaten multiple countries at once.  Consecutive Action Rounds are one of the holy grails of Twilight Struggle, and Che comes close.</p>
<p>The best use of Che comes when you can make two threats and the US can only respond to one.  Most non-battleground countries are valuable for their connection to a battleground, and sometimes the only response to an attack on a non-battleground is to coup it back.  When you identify two such non-battlegrounds, take advantage of the opportunity to double coup.  Now the US must choose one non-battleground to respond in, and you are free to leverage the other non-battleground against an adjacent battleground (either by direct influence placement or realignment).</p>
<p>Che gets better as the game goes on and more influence is invested into non-battlegrounds.  Most games tend to have a pattern of low investment into non-battlegrounds (out of fear of being couped out), followed by rapid investment into non-battlegrounds (where there is no longer enough &#8220;time&#8221; / Action Rounds to coup them all back efficiently).  It is in that later stage that Che becomes so powerful.</p>
<p>The fact that Che earns you Mil Ops (unlike <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a>) is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have any targets (or only one target), it&#8217;s a relatively safe play, particularly since you can coup back whatever Che coups.  It&#8217;s also safe if your non-battlegrounds are 3-stability (i.e., Costa Rica).  But once you get into the stage of owning many non-battlegrounds, as described above, Che is too dangerous to play (it is equivalent to 6 Ops for the USSR!) and better off sent to space.</p>
